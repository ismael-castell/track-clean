/* there needs to be support for Unicode here,

 * by adding every four 16-bit characters and
 * shortening the sum to 32 bits). Otherwise
 * I suggest performing MD-5 as if every character
 * was two bytes--e.g., 0040 0025 = @%--but then
 * how will an ordinary MD-5 sum be matched?
 * There is no way to standardize text to something
 * like UTF-8 before transformation; speed cost is
 * utterly prohibitive. The JavaScript standard
 * itself needs to look at this: it should start
 * providing access to strings as preformed UTF-8
 * 8-bit unsigned value arrays.
