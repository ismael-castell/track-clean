/**
 * For jQuery versions less than 3.5.0, this replaces the jQuery.htmlPrefilter()
 * function with one that fixes these security vulnerabilities while also
 * retaining the pre-3.5.0 behavior where it's safe to do so.

 * - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11023
 *
 * Additionally, for jQuery versions that do not have a jQuery.htmlPrefilter()
 * function (1.x prior to 1.12 and 2.x prior to 2.2), this adds it, and
 * extends the functions that need to call it to do so.
 *
 * Drupal core's jQuery version is 1.4.4, but jQuery Update can provide a
 * different version, so this covers all versions between 1.4.4 and 3.4.1.
 * The GitHub links in the code comments below link to jQuery 1.5 code, because
 * 1.4.4 isn't on GitHub, but the referenced code didn't change from 1.4.4 to
 * 1.5.
