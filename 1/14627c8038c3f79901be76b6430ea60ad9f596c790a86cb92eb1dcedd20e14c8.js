/*
 * Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in
 * the current UA and makes the results available to you in two ways:
 * as properties on a global Modernizr object, and as classes on the
 * <html> element. This information allows you to progressively enhance
 * your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.
 *
 * Modernizr has an optional (not included) conditional resource loader
 * called Modernizr.load(), based on Yepnope.js (yepnopejs.com).
 * To get a build that includes Modernizr.load(), as well as choosing
 * which tests to include, go to www.modernizr.com/download/
