 *
 * Drupal core's jQuery version is 1.4.4, but jQuery Update can provide a
 * different version, so this covers all versions between 1.4.4 and 3.4.1.
 * The GitHub links in the code comments below link to jQuery 1.5 code, because
 * 1.4.4 isn't on GitHub, but the referenced code didn't change from 1.4.4 to
 * 1.5.
